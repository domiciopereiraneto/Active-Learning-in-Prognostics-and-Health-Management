# Active Learning in Prognostics and Health Management
Project realized in the context of the Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence 2021/2022 project.

It consists of three main scripts:
1. feature_extraction.m: A matlab script that loads the original dataset, extracts time and frequency-domain features and saves the new dataset to a .csv file.
2. phm_active_learning.ipynb: A jupyter notebook with all the pipeline used during the study. It contains the set of parameters associated with the results obtained during this work.
3. results.ipynb: A jupyter notebook used for presenting the results and figures that are in the final report.

In order to replicate the results presented in the final report, it is necessary to execute the scripts above in the same order. The second script must be executed once for each of the 20 pairs of parameters.
